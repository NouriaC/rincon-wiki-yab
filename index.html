            Yann Arthus-Bertrand (French, b.1946) is a photographer and
            journalist. Specializing in documentaries on sports, wildlife, and
            arial photography, he has published work in Paris Match, GEO, and
            others.

            In 1991 he founded Altitude Agency, the first photo agency
            specializing in arial photography. As part of his environmental
            activism, in 2012 Arthus-Betrand founded Hope, a non-profit
            production company of documentaries. His best-known film Home is
            composed almost entirely of arial shots of the Earth, and depicts
            man-made threats to the environment. Arthus-Betrand is the recipient
            of numerous awards, including The Royal Geographical Society’s
            Cherry Kearton Medal and Award, the National Outdoor Book Award, and
            an Honorary Fellowship of The Royal Photographic Society.
